# models/__init__.py

"""
This file makes Python treat the 'models' directory as a package.
You can leave this file empty, or use it to import or expose
package-wide variables, functions, or classes.
"""

# Optionally, you can import from your model module here.
# For example, uncomment the following line if you want to make
# UNet2D accessible as models.UNet2D directly:
#
# from .model import UNetDeep
